  Turns out creating a pull request requires a lot more effort than just commiting your changes and uploading to a VCS.

It's common for developers to work on a feature for an extended period and then submit a pull request (PR) with a large
number of code changes. However, this can make it challenging for reviewers to effectively review the code, leading to
delays in merging the PR.

While some developers try to address this by separating their changes on a per-file basis, this approach can present
challenges, as it may not always be feasible or ideal to ensure complete and thoroughly tested code for each individual
file before merging and it also makes it hard for the reviewer to understand the code changes you are making for this
feature. This can sometimes lead to incomplete or broken code being integrated, and I've observed comments like:

- _"I will add unit tests later"_
- _"It is not possible to test this piece of code at this point"_

When a pull request isn't readily testable, it often indicates that the design approach could benefit from further
refinement. Instead of focusing on the reviewer's request to break down the changes, it's valuable to take a moment to
reflect on the design decisions and consider how they might be impacting testability. This collaborative approach can
lead to more robust and maintainable code in the long run.

In this post, I'd like to share my approach to creating pull requests, along with the reasoning behind each decision. I
hope this provides some helpful insights into my workflow.

## Size of pull requests

As a reviewer, I have limited time to dedicate to each pull request. A large pull request can be daunting and may lead
to delays as it gets put aside for a less busy time. However, a smaller pull request, such as one with around 20 lines
of code, is much more manageable and can often be reviewed quickly. Keeping pull requests concise and focused can
greatly improve the review process for everyone involved.

Some reasons why creating small pull requests is important:

- <ListItemTitle>Reviewed more quickly and throughly</ListItemTitle>: As a reviewer, I don't have hours to review your
  code. I will probably look at the pull request, and if it is too big, just close the tab or keep procastinating it to
  a later point in time. However, if you send me a small PR, say 20 lines of code, I will be more than happy to review
  it instantly. Also, if a PR is too big, then some reviewers might just give an LGTM without even reviewing it which
  will worsen the code health.
- <ListItemTitle>Small, self-contained PRs allow you to work in parallel</ListItemTitle>
- <ListItemTitle>Less likely to cause merge conflicts</ListItemTitle>
- <ListItemTitle>Low chances of introducing bugs</ListItemTitle>
- <ListItemTitle>Easier to design well</ListItemTitle>: It's simpler to polish the design and code health of a small
  change than it is to refine all the details of a large change.

  Experienced authors who prioritize writing small PRs are generally capable of breaking down _**any complex
  functionality**_ into a series of small and manageable PRs.
</Note>

<br />

While there is no golden size of a PR, but usually, a PR should be **one self-contained change** and it means that:

- the PR just addresses a single thing.
- the PR includes all the relevant test code and should test for all branches within the code
- the build shouldn't break after mergeing the PR

  I generally like to keep my PRs under 250 lines of code. Your team can determine a reasonable number that works best
  for you.
</Note>

## Exceptions

Some cases when creating big PRs is unavoidable and ok:

- Large Refactor
- Code deletion / cleanup

## Creating small PRs

I'd like to share my approach to creating smaller pull requests and explore whether a similar workflow might be
beneficial for your work.

1. <ListItemTitle>Create a Low Level Design (LLD) for this feature</ListItemTitle>- The classes/interfaces you plan to
   create or modify - The functions/methods you will add or update - The signatures of these functions/methods - Any
   other relevant implementation details
1. <ListItemTitle>Get the LLD reviewed by your colleagues.</ListItemTitle> This can be done either by:

   - Writing a doc about the LLD
   - Your first PR that only creates the class, interface, and function definitions but not their implementation

1. <ListItemTitle>Create a PR with LLD</ListItemTitle>: Create the first PR that only contains the class, interface and
   function definations but not their implementation, if not done already in the previous step
1. <ListItemTitle>Implement each class, interface and function in a different PR</ListItemTitle>: Now that you have
   identified all classes, interfaces and functions, implementing each of them in a different PR will be easy and you
   should also be able to test the public signature of it.

During the implementation phase, it's not uncommon to realize that adjustments to a public API are necessary, such as
adding, removing, or modifying function arguments or return types.

In this situation, a best practice is to:

1. Pause work on your current pull request.
1. Create a new branch dedicated to the API changes. This keeps your changes organized and isolated.
1. Thoroughly do all API modifications in this dedicated branch.
1. Get the API changes reviewed and merged.
1. Communicate these changes clearly to all developers working on the affected classes. It's helpful to provide context
   for the changes and explain how they might impact their work. Suggest they rebase their branches onto the updated API
   branch to ensure everyone is working with the latest version.

## Conclusion

This approach of creating small PRs has been very effective for me, and I believe it could be beneficial for you too. It
does require discipline and some practice, but once you've integrated it into your workflow, you'll likely find it
preferable to other methods.
