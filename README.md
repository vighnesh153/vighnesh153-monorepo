Welcome to my mono-repo. This repository contains (will contain) source code of all the projects that I work on and
publish to the outside world.

### Something broken?

### Pending projects

#### Role based access control on vighnesh153.com

Roles have limitations. There will always be a case where we wouldn't want to give 1 permission to a person, but we want
to give that permission to some other person. So, this leads to creating an extra role. And again in the future, this
issue will occur again which will lead to creation of `N` number of roles which is basically what `groups` are meant
for. So, instead of relying on roles, I will be creating `groups` and grant permissions to groups

- 3 major groups
  - Root (only me)
  - PeopleILike (includes people I love and want to give CRUD permissions to the majority of the projects)
  - Everyone (will mostly have read permissions for `almost` everything)
- Access: Access to a resource will be granted based on following criteria
  - To a group
  - To a specific email
