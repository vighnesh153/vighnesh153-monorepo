# Why I moved on from React.js and Next.js?

## Introduction

[React.js] and [Next.js] are the de-facto standard for building web user interfaces in a lot of different companies
including the big companies like [Amazon], [Netflix], etc. And also, why not? [React.js] is a battle tested library
which can be used to solve almost all the problems on the UI. It was also the first ever library to introduce the
declarative approach of building UIs, by defining the UI as a function of its state.

## Is [React.js] still a relevant technology today?

There are a crap ton of web interfaces that are built in [React.js] and even today, lot of people use [React.js] to give
a web-based UI to their projects. If you learn [React.js] today, you will still have a job in the frontend space for at
least a decade.

## Problems with [React.js] and [Next.js]

Nothing in this world is perfect and this applies to software constructs too. [React.js], although, is one of the most
loved libraries, still has problems that cannot be over-looked. Following are some of the problems that made me quit on
[React.js]:

### 1. Minimum javascript bundle size

Even if you build a hello world UI

### 2. Server components and `use client | server` directives all over the place
