#### Email service (Priority: P0)

This service/lambda will allow me to send email to any users

##### Features

- Should include a SQS queue where I will push new messages.
  - Message will include `to`, `from`, `subject`, `cc`, `bcc`, `message` fields.
  - Probably store the above fields in a NoSQL DB table and only add the `messageId` to the above message?
- An internal API endpoint to add messages to the email queue
- A lambda will be connected to the SQS which will send an email based on the message from the queue
  - Perform validation to check if the `from` field matches my domain `.*@vighnesh153\.com`. Most of the time, the
    `from` field will be `no-reply@vighnesh153.com`

#### Push notifications (Priority: P2)

This will allow me to send push notifications to users

##### Features

- Should include a SQS queue where I will push new messages
  - Message will include `icon`, `messageTitle`, `messageBody`, `platforms`, etc. fields
    - Platforms include Mobile Push notification, Desktop push notification, etc.
  - Probably store the above fields in a NoSQL DB table and only add the `messageId` to the above message?
- An internal API endpoint to add messages to the email queue
- A lambda will be connected to the above SQS which will send the notification

#### Email bans (Priority: P0)

- Ban spammers for `X` number of days (the next ban will be twice the previous one)
- 5 bans will lead to permanent ban (will need to reach out to me with proper explanation for getting un-banned)

#### Role based access control on vighnesh153.com (Priority: P0)

Roles have limitations. There will always be a case where we wouldn't want to give 1 permission to a person, but we want
to give that permission to some other person. So, this leads to creating an extra role. And again in the future, this
issue will occur again which will lead to creation of `N` number of roles which is basically what `groups` are meant
for. So, instead of relying on roles, I will be creating `groups` and grant permissions to groups

- 3 major groups
  - Root (only me)
  - PeopleILike (includes people I love and want to give CRUD permissions to the majority of the projects)
  - Everyone (will mostly have read permissions for `almost` everything)
- Access: Access to a resource will be granted based on following criteria
  - To a group
  - To a specific email

#### Dating ‚ù§Ô∏è Compatibility Test üß™ (Priority: P1)
